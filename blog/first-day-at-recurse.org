#+DESCRIPTION:

Today is a good day. I'm starting batch at Recurse Center. This blog
is the first thing I'm putting together so I can document my journey
and share achievements and experiences!

One of my goals during the retreat is to learn more about programming
languages. My first warmup task towards this goal at Recurse Center
will be to add macro support to the lil lisp interpreter I started for
my interview.
