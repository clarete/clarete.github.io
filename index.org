#+TITLE: Hi! I'm Lincoln

I'm a human being that deeply enjoys the art of computer
programming. I'm very curious and interested in various programming
languages and technologies ranging from web development to systems
programming.

I'll most certainly open pull requests against random codebases on the
wild internet whenever I spot typos, dead code, memory overflows, low
test coverage, or brittle built systems.

I'm most happy when I can use my knowledge to promote social justice
and advance how human societies interact and communicate. When I'm not
on the computer, I'm usually hanging out with friends, and/or enjoying
another random art form, like drawing, longboarding, photography, or
just looking at the sky.
