      <h1>Hi! I&#39;m Lincoln</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a human being that deeply enjoys the art of computer
        programming. I'm very curious and interested in various
        programming languages and technologies ranging from web
        development to systems programming.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'll most certainly open pull requests against random
        codebases on the wild internet whenever I spot typos, dead
        code, memory overflows, low test coverage, or brittle built
        systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm most happy when I can use my knowledge to promote
        social justice and advance how human societies interact
        and communicate.  When I'm not on the computer, I'm
        usually hanging out with friends, and/or enjoying another
        random art form, like drawing, longboarding, photography,
        or just looking at the sky.
